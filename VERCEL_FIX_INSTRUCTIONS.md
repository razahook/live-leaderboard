# Fix for Vercel Authentication Issue

## Problem
Your Apex Legends Leaderboard is currently behind Vercel's authentication protection, which is blocking access to both the frontend and API endpoints.

## Solution
You need to disable the Vercel Protection for this project:

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard**
   - Visit https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `live-leaderboard`

2. **Navigate to Settings**
   - Click on the "Settings" tab in your project

3. **Find Security/Protection Settings**
   - Look for "Vercel Protection" or "Authentication" settings
   - This might be under "Security" or "General" settings

4. **Disable Protection**
   - Turn off "Vercel Protection" or any authentication requirements
   - Make sure the application is set to "Public" access

5. **Redeploy (if needed)**
   - The changes should take effect immediately
   - If not, trigger a new deployment

### Alternative: Environment-based Fix
If you can't find the settings, try adding this to your project's environment variables:
- `VERCEL_PROTECTION_BYPASS=1`

### After Fix
Once authentication is disabled, your leaderboard should be accessible at:
https://live-leaderboard-8aq8bbybp-razahooks-projects.vercel.app/

## Technical Details
- ✅ Backend API is fully functional (tested locally)
- ✅ All import issues fixed for Vercel deployment
- ✅ Consolidated to single function to avoid 12-function limit
- ❌ Only issue is Vercel authentication blocking access

## Verification
After disabling protection, these endpoints should work:
- `/` - Main application
- `/api/health` - Health check
- `/api/leaderboard/PC` - Leaderboard data
- `/api/predator-points` - Predator thresholds

The leaderboard will then display data properly without "API errors".
