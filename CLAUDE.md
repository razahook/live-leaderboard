* Use your streamlined MCP toolkit to fix my stream loading issues:

1. **Get Current Docs**: Use Context7 to research latest Twitch Embed API documentation and video embedding best practices
2. **Structure Approach**: Use Sequential Thinking to break down the debugging systematically
3. **Browser Testing**: Use Playwright (fullscreen, wait 15 seconds for manual login) to test actual functionality
4. **Direct Code Analysis**: Use your built-in code analysis to examine the stream loading logic

Fix why streams don't load when selected from dropdowns, using current documentation and systematic approach. No redundant tools - just focused, effective debugging.
