# Apex Legends Leaderboard - Multistream Project Context

## 🎯 Project Overview
This is an Apex Legends ranked leaderboard application deployed on Vercel that scrapes live player data from apexlegendsstatus.com and integrates with Twitch to show live streamers. The main feature is a multistream viewer that allows watching multiple live Apex streamers simultaneously.

## 🚀 What We Just Accomplished

### ✅ Fixed Multistream Dropdown Issue
**Problem:** The multistream dropdown was showing offline players with 0 viewers and hardcoded entries instead of only live streamers.

**Root Cause:** The filtering logic was too permissive - it was including players based on in-game status ("In match") rather than actual Twitch live status.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Strengthened filtering logic** in `public/index.html` at line ~2776 in the `populateStreamerDropdowns()` function
2. **Removed hardcoded entries** - eliminated the hardcoded "anayaunni" option that was always added
3. **Made fully dynamic** - dropdown now populates entirely from real API data

**New Filter Requirements (ALL must be true):**
```javascript
const twitchLive = player.twitch_live?.is_live === true;        // Confirmed live on Twitch API
const hasStreamData = player.stream !== null;                   // Has stream object
const hasViewers = player.stream?.viewers >= 0;                 // Has viewer count
const hasTwitchUser = player.stream?.twitchUser?.length > 0;     // Has Twitch username
const statusIsLive = player.status === "Live";                  // Backend marked as Live
```

**Files Modified:**
- `public/index.html` - Fixed `populateStreamerDropdowns()` and `getCanonicalTwitchUsername()` functions

**Result:** ✅ Dropdown now shows only genuine live streamers with viewer counts, no offline players

## 🎬 Next Priority: Improve Multistream Clipping System

**Current Issue:** User reports that "the clipping is terrible" in the multistream viewer.

### Current Clipping Implementation Analysis

**Location:** `public/index.html` around lines 3500-3800

**Current Features:**
- Live clip creation via Twitch OAuth
- Rewind clipping from HLS segments  
- VOD/clips display in tabs
- Manual clip creation buttons

**Potential Issues to Investigate:**
1. **Clip Quality:** Low resolution/bitrate clips
2. **Clip Timing:** Incorrect start/end times or lag
3. **Clip Reliability:** Failed clip creation or upload
4. **User Experience:** Confusing UI or workflow
5. **Performance:** Slow clip processing or buffering

### Key Functions to Review:
```javascript
// Live clip creation
createLiveClip(username, displayName)

// Rewind clipping setup  
setupRewindClipping(index, streamer, clipCreateButton)

// Clip management
createClipFromRewind(streamer, seconds, duration)
```

### API Endpoints to Check:
- `/api/twitch/create-clip` - Live clip creation
- `/api/stream-live-stream/${streamer}` - HLS stream access
- `/api/twitch/rewind-clip` - Rewind clip creation

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure Context

### Core Backend Files:
- **`src/routes/leaderboard_scraper.py`** - Main scraping logic, extracts 750 real players from apexlegendsstatus.com
- **`src/routes/twitch_integration.py`** - Twitch API integration, live status checking, username extraction
- **`src/routes/twitch_oauth.py`** - OAuth flow for clip creation permissions
- **`public/index.html`** - Single-page frontend application with multistream viewer

### API Architecture:
- **Leaderboard:** `/api/stats/PC` - Returns 750 players with Twitch live status
- **Twitch Live:** Batch checking of up to 750 streamers for live status
- **OAuth Flow:** `/api/session/start` and `/api/session/complete` for Twitch permissions

### Current Live Stats (as of last check):
- **24+ live streamers** detected and working
- **Viewer counts:** Range from 2 to 600+ viewers
- **Dynamic updates:** Every 60 seconds with countdown timer

## 🔧 Technical Context for Next Session

### Twitch Integration Details:
```javascript
// Current multistream structure (3 panels)
const streamers = [streamer1, streamer2, streamer3].filter(s => s);

// Live detection logic (working correctly now)
const isLive = player.twitch_live?.is_live === true && player.stream;

// Stream embedding (using Twitch embed API)
new Twitch.Embed(`stream-${index}`, {
    width: '100%', height: 400,
    channel: canonicalTwitchUsername
});
```

### Clipping System Components:
1. **Live Clipping:** Uses Twitch Helix API `/clips` endpoint
2. **Rewind Clipping:** Captures HLS segments for VOD-disabled streamers  
3. **OAuth Integration:** Manages user permissions for clip creation
4. **UI Tabs:** Stream view vs Clips view per multistream panel

### Deployment:
- **Platform:** Vercel serverless
- **Domain:** https://live-leaderboard-plum.vercel.app
- **Auto-deploy:** On git push to main branch
- **Environment:** Python Flask backend + vanilla JS frontend

## 🎯 Action Items for Next Session

### 1. Diagnose Clipping Issues
```bash
# Test current clip creation
curl -X POST "https://live-leaderboard-plum.vercel.app/api/twitch/create-clip" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "4rufq", "title": "Test Clip"}'
```

### 2. Areas to Investigate:
- [ ] Check clip creation success rates in logs
- [ ] Review clip quality settings (resolution, bitrate)
- [ ] Test rewind clipping accuracy and timing
- [ ] Analyze user workflow and UI/UX issues
- [ ] Verify OAuth permissions and error handling

### 3. Potential Improvements:
- [ ] Higher quality clip settings
- [ ] Better timing controls (precise start/end)
- [ ] Improved error messages and user feedback
- [ ] Faster clip processing and preview
- [ ] Better clip organization and management

### 4. Files to Focus On:
- `public/index.html` (lines ~3500-3800) - Clip creation UI/logic
- `src/routes/twitch_oauth.py` - OAuth and clip API calls
- Console logs in browser dev tools for clip creation errors
