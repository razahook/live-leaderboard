# Bug Fixes Summary

This document outlines three critical bugs that were identified and fixed in the Apex Legends Leaderboard application.

## Bug 1: Hardcoded API Keys and Secrets (Security Vulnerability)

### Location
- `api/index.py` (lines 12-13)
- `src/routes/twitch_integration.py` (lines 23-24)
- `src/routes/tracker_proxy.py` (line 10)
- `index.html` (lines 364-366)

### Issue
API keys and secrets were hardcoded directly in the source code, exposing sensitive credentials to anyone with access to the repository.

### Impact
- **Security Risk**: Exposed Twitch API credentials, Tracker.gg API key, and Gemini API key
- **Unauthorized Access**: Potential for malicious actors to use the API keys
- **Quota Exhaustion**: Risk of API quota being consumed by unauthorized users
- **Compliance Issues**: Violation of security best practices

### Fix Applied
1. **Moved all API keys to environment variables**:
   - `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` and `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` now read from environment
   - `TRACKER_GG_API_KEY` now read from environment
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` now read from environment

2. **Updated frontend to use backend API**:
   - Removed hardcoded API keys from client-side JavaScript
   - Created new `/api/ai-analysis` endpoint to proxy AI requests
   - Frontend now makes requests to backend instead of directly to external APIs

3. **Files Modified**:
   - `api/index.py`: Updated credential loading and added AI analysis endpoint
   - `src/routes/twitch_integration.py`: Updated credential loading
   - `src/routes/tracker_proxy.py`: Updated credential loading
   - `index.html`: Removed hardcoded keys and updated API calls

### Security Improvement
- Credentials are now properly secured and not exposed in source code
- Backend acts as a secure proxy for external API calls
- Environment variables provide proper secret management

## Bug 2: Missing Input Validation (Security Vulnerability)

### Location
- `src/routes/user.py` (all user endpoints)
- `api/index.py` (user management endpoints)

### Issue
User management endpoints lacked proper input validation, allowing potentially malicious or invalid data to be processed.

### Impact
- **Data Integrity**: Invalid data could corrupt the database
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Potential for injection attacks
- **Application Stability**: Malformed data could cause crashes
- **User Experience**: Poor error handling for invalid inputs

### Fix Applied
1. **Added comprehensive input validation**:
   - Username validation: 3-80 characters, required
   - Email validation: Must contain '@', max 120 characters
   - Data sanitization: Trim whitespace from inputs

2. **Added duplicate checking**:
   - Check for existing usernames before creation/update
   - Check for existing emails before creation/update
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes (409 for conflicts)

3. **Improved error handling**:
   - Database rollback on errors
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - Descriptive error messages

4. **Files Modified**:
   - `src/routes/user.py`: Added validation to all user endpoints
   - `api/index.py`: Added validation to user management endpoints

### Security Improvement
- Prevents malicious data injection
- Ensures data integrity
- Provides better error handling and user feedback

---

## Bug 3: XSS Vulnerability in Frontend (Security Vulnerability)

### Location
- `index.html` (multiple locations using `innerHTML`)

### Issue
The frontend code used `innerHTML` to insert user-controlled data directly into the DOM without proper escaping, creating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

### Impact
- **XSS Attacks**: Malicious scripts could be executed in users' browsers
- **Session Hijacking**: Attackers could steal user sessions
- **Data Theft**: Sensitive information could be compromised
- **Account Compromise**: Complete user account takeover possible

### Fix Applied
1. **Added HTML escaping function**:
   - Created `escapeHtml()` utility function
   - Properly escapes special characters to prevent script injection

2. **Applied escaping to user data**:
   - Player names in leaderboard rows
   - AI analysis responses
   - Error messages
   - All user-controlled data displayed via `innerHTML`

3. **Specific fixes**:
   - Leaderboard row generation: Escaped player names, ranks, and other data
   - AI analysis responses: Escaped AI-generated content
   - Error messages: Escaped error text displayed to users

4. **Files Modified**:
   - `index.html`: Added escape function and applied escaping throughout

### Security Improvement
- Prevents XSS attacks from user-controlled data
- Ensures all dynamic content is properly sanitized
- Maintains functionality while improving security

---

## Summary

These three bug fixes significantly improve the security posture of the application:

1. **Credential Security**: API keys are now properly secured
2. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
3. **XSS Protection**: User data is properly escaped to prevent script injection

### Recommendations for Further Security Improvements

1. **Add rate limiting** to prevent API abuse
2. **Implement CSRF protection** for form submissions
3. **Add request logging** for security monitoring
4. **Consider adding authentication** for sensitive operations
5. **Regular security audits** of the codebase

### Environment Variables Required

The following environment variables must be set for the application to function:

```bash
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=your_twitch_client_id
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_twitch_client_secret
TRACKER_GG_API_KEY=your_tracker_gg_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
APEX_API_KEY=your_apex_api_key
```

### Testing Recommendations

1. Test all user endpoints with invalid data
2. Verify XSS protection with malicious input
3. Confirm API keys are not exposed in client-side code
4. Test error handling and validation messages
